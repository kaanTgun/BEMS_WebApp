# About this project 

The electricity grid functions in a real-time environment where the demand must be met by supply 
at all time. With the increased adaptation of renewable resources, it is more important than ever 
to balance the power grid and avoid any power shortages. 
This project is an interactive and visual representation of control strategies used to solve the energy arbitrage problem.
