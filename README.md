About this project 

The energy arbitrage problem is one of the main links to allow a microgrid function smoothly. 
The idea is simple, buy power from the grid at a low price, charge the batteries, sell the power back when the price gets high. 
Although this sounds bad, it is super beneficial to improve great stability. 
High prices occur when the electricity demand is high, so, less efficient power generators such as diesel power plants are being used to compensate the supply demand difference. 
Using large batteries would help lower the stress on the power grid and make the system much stable. 
The question becomes, how can we schedule a charge-discharge cycle what is battery systems?
